# Licensing

You are free to use this file if all of the following conditions are met:

1. It is the last loaded/injected CSS file with the basic exception of user/extension injected stylesheets.
* It is not subject to below-the-end modification.
* You give referencing in either the document itself, linking to the document itself or leaving the `dizzyzane.github.io/lightbox` in the CSS file/injection of CSS.

If all of those conditions are met (#3 only requires 1 of them to be met) you are free to use the lightbox.

Methods of adding to the document:

* `<link href="//dizzyzane.github.io/lightbox/lb.css" rel="stylesheet">`
 * Delivers only via HTTP/HTTPS. This is the minified version.
* (in a stylesheet): `@import ('https://dizzyzane.github.io/lightbox/lb.css') all;`
 * This is not one I recommend.
* Self hosting of the file: `<link href="/path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet">`
 * I do allow (and do recommend) that this is done, however it isn't perfect, obviously.
